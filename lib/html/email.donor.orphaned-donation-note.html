                        <em>PLEASE NOTE:</em> PickUpMyDonation.com does not have actual trucks that provide a pick up service. However, our role is to reach out to as many non-profits in your community as we can to see if they would be willing to pick up your donation. We hope this saves you time and energy on what used to be a tedious process. Our service can take up to 48 hours (maybe a bit longer for those submitted over the weekend).
                        <br><br>
                        We hope you are contacted directly by one of these organizations and that your donation finds a new home.  However, if someone does not respond directly within 48 hours, please know that there is a chance that there was no one in our database who could provide a pick up in your area at this time.
                        <br><br>
                        Our goal is to make the donation scheduling process as simple as possible for you. Thank you for your generosity and for allowing us to assist you in getting your donation picked up.
