<h3>How to Import Pick Up Providers</h3>
<p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Setup your CSV with the following columns (<code>store_name</code>, <code>zipcode</code>, <code>email</code>, <code>receive_emails</code>, and <code>priority</code>):</p>

<table class="widefat">
	<thead>
		<tr class="alternate">
			<th>store_name</th>
			<th>zipcode</th>
			<th>email</th>
			<th>receive_emails</th>
			<th>priority</th>
		</tr>
	</thead>
	<tbody>
		<tr>
			<td>Non-Profit Store</td>
			<td>12345</td>
			<td>nonprofit@example.org</td>
			<td>1</td>
			<td>0</td>
		</tr>
		<tr class="alternate">
			<td>PRIORITY Pick Up Provider</td>
			<td>98765</td>
			<td>priority@example.com</td>
			<td>1</td>
			<td>1</td>
		</tr>
	</tbody>
</table>
<p>Please note that the above table has one header row followed by two <em>example</em> rows. Don't include the examples in your CSV.</p>

<h5>Notes</h5>
<ul>
<li><code>receive_emails</code> (<code>0</code> or <code>1</code>) -  <code>0</code> = <code>false</code> (i.e. don't receive emails), <code>1</code> = <code>true</code> (i.e. receive emails). If this is your first time uploading all the contacts in your CSV, then <code>receive_emails</code> should be set to <code>1</code> for all rows in your CSV.</li>
<li><code>priority</code> (<code>0</code> or <code>1</code>) - <code>0</code> for non-profits, <code>1</code> for priority pick up providers.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Upload your CSV via the <em>Upload a CSV</em> dialog below. After your CSV has uploaded, click on the button labeled <em>Insert Into Post</em>. Your new CSV will appear in the list below.</p>

<p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Click on the title of your uploaded CSV to preview the first five rows. If everything looks "ok", click on the button to import the file. <strong>IMPORANT:</strong> <em>Do not close your browser while the upload is working.</em> Once your import has finished, you may delete your CSV.</p>
